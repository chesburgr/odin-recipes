    <ul>
        <li>8 oz. boneless skinless Chicken Thighs (or Chicken Breast)</li>
        <li> Salt + freshly cracked Black Pepper</li>
        <li>½ tsp. Cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Olive Oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup Half and Half </li>
        <li>2 cloves Garlic </li>
        <li>1 large Chipotle Pepper + 1 tsp. Adobo Sauce (from the same can)</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Honey</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup finely chopped Yellow Onion </li>
        <li> ½ cup finely chopped Yellow Bell Pepper </li>
        <li> 6 stalks Asparagus, chopped into ½ inch pieces >> ½ cup</li>
        <li> ½ lb. dried Penne Pasta (or your favorite type of pasta)</li>
        <li>¼ cup Grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>½ cup Pasta Water</li>
        <li>Chopped Green Onion, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken thighs (or chicken breasts) all over with a good pinch of salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Set the chicken aside for now.        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Make Spicy Chipotle Cream Sauce: </strong>Combine half and half, garlic cloves, honey, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce from the canned chipotles, and a pinch of salt in a small blender or food processor. Blend until totally combined, then set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cook Veggies: </strong>In the same pan the chicken was cooked in, add the chopped yellow bell peppers and chopped onions with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring every now and then to incorporate any browned bits from the bottom of the pan into the vegetables as they cook.        </li> <br>
        <li><strong>Boil Pasta in a Separate Pot: </strong>At this time, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Pour in the dried noodles, stir them around, and cook according to package instructions, minus about one minute for al dente pasta.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Add Asparagus: </strong>Once the peppers and onions are mostly softened, toss the chopped asparagus into the pan with them. Cook, stirring every so often, for 3-4 minutes until the asparagus begins to soften.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Add Chipotle Cream Sauce to Veggies:</strong> Pour the chipotle cream sauce into the pan with the vegetables. Stir to mix in the vegetables, then cook for about 5-6 minutes (while the pasta finishes boiling) until the cream sauce has thickened. While the cream sauce cooks, cut the cooked chicken into bite-size pieces.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Toss Pasta with Sauce: </strong>Transfer the cooked pasta to the pan with the cream sauce and stir to coat the noodles completely with sauce.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Add Chicken, Cheese, and Flavor: </strong>Add the chopped chicken, parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and a touch of salt and pepper to taste. Stir to thoroughly combine all ingredients and coat the noodles and chicken with chipotle cream sauce. Add about 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water and stir to mix it in. To make the sauce creamier, stir in more pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
