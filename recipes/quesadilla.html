    <h2 class="smallheading">Our absolutely favorite cheesy ground beef quesadillas recipe. These come together in about 30 minutes, and
        makes 2-3 servings.</h2>
        <p class="lists"> Fresh ingredients (like vegetables, garlic, and lime juice), taco seasoning, some refried beans (for texture!),
        and gooey cheese are BIG flavor components! <br>
        They're everything you need for a delicious quesadilla, and nothing more. (Trust me, I'm a huge fan of
        quesadillas.) 
        These are a perfect Taco Tuesday idea if you're not feeling tacos,
        and they're also the perfect meal for a quick, easy, and super flavorful dinner!</p>
    <h2 class="smallheading"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted Butter </li>
        <li>Fresh Tomato (Roma/Plum)</li>
        <li>White Onion</li>
        <li>Bell Pepper (Any color! I love green or red, personally.)</li>
        <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt & Freshly Cracked Pepper</li>
        <li>Ground Beef (An 80/20 blend or lean ground beef works!)</li>
        <li>Taco Seasoning</li>
        <li> Refried Beans</li>
        <li> Fresh Lime Juice</li>
        <li> 8â€³ Flour Tortillas</li>
        <li> Shredded Cheddar & Shredded Jack Cheese (such as Colby Jack, Monterey Jack, or Pepper Jack)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="numbered">
        <li>Blend the shredded cheese together if using more than one variety.</li><br>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, and garlic with a pinch
            of salt and pepper. Cook for 5-7 minutes until slightly tender.</li><br>
        <li>Add the ground beef and taco seasoning to the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to break the beef into smaller
            pieces and mix it into the veggies. Brown the ground beef (this takes about 5 minutes), continuing to break
            it into smaller pieces as it browns.</li> <br>
        <li>Stir in the refried beans. Transfer the meat mixture to a large bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. </li> <br>
        <li>Place a tortilla in the now empty skillet. Sprinkle half a cup of shredded cheese across the top of the
            entire tortilla. Spoon half a cup of the meat mixture onto one half of the tortilla. Spread it across the
            cheese over the entire half of the tortilla.</li> <br>
        <li>Once the cheese is melted on the other half of the tortilla, carefully fold that half onto the beef mixture.
            Use a spatula to gently press down on top of the folded tortilla. <br>
            Cook for about two minutes until the
            bottom is golden brown and crispy.<br><br>
        <li>Carefully flip the tortilla. Cook for another two minutes until the bottom side is also golden brown and
            crispy. Transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board and allow it to cool for about 30 seconds. Use a pizza
            cutter or sharp knife to cut it in half. </li> <br>
        <li>Repeat with remaining two tortillas, cheese, and meat mixture.</li>
    </ol>
